  As somebody who has grown up playing Playstation 2, with games like Ratchet and Clank and Sly Cooper as the basis for my love for open ended video games. As I grew up the titles got bigger and video games were really my escape from reality, they produced a wonder of fun and excitement. So as I started to teach myself programming languages, the object was to make video games. I made a Java vector graphics game, with a sort of animation and collision detection that proved I in fact could program a video game. So when I was presented with the possibility and time in order to make a video game, I jumped at the opportunity.

	I wanted to make something that hasn’t been done before. I recently played Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild(ZBOTW), and I knew then what kind of game I wanted to make. As I see it, I break games down by three things, Perspective, gameplay type, and Gameplay hook.
Perspective is whether the game is 1st person, 3rd person, top-down, sidescroller, or a combination of 2 or more perspectives. This is what I see as a very basic, yet crucial design system. I chose a 3rd person design, as it lets the player see who they are controlling, as well as to see their environments and interact well within it. It also allows for a number of Heads up Display factors(or HUD) to seemingly disappear. Health can be visually interpreted and inventory displayed by items showing up on a backpack.
Gameplay type is very vague in that it can be titled as just 1 thing, or seemingly infinite things depending on how specific you title things.  Essentially this is what the game fits into. So take ZBOTW. It is firstly an open world game, it has gameplay that pushes you to explore, making it an exploration game. Next it has combat that is high intensity, categorizing it as its 3rd major game as action game. There are small gameplay bits and different tactics, but I generally take the top three of the pile and label it as such.
	A gameplay hook is the leading feature in a game. It is what separates it from other games in general, or games in its own series. An example is something like Cuphead’s art style, or Rocket League’s take on a typical sports game. Things like these make a game more appealing and unique.
